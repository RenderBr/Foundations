# ‚õ©Ô∏è Foundations

An [EssentialsPlus](https://github.com/QuiCM/EssentialsPlus) successor. 
Foundations is my attempt at re-creating EssentialsPlus, along with providing an easy to use API for other plugin developers. This plugin is essentially a collection of very useful commands and other features. A lot of it is inspired from other plugins. Feel free to recommend commands or features!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies:

Foundations releases are already bundled with all of the dependencies required **HOWEVER, an active & working MongoDB is required for Auxiliary to function properly,** which Foundations depends on.
- CSF.Net.TShock
- Auxiliary
